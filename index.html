Dear {mp.Contact},

My name is {Your Full Name?} and I am a constituent writing to you from {Your Suburb or Town?}.

I am writing to you today to express my profound distress regarding the ongoing humanitarian crisis in
Palestine. The loss of innocent lives, the destruction of homes, and the denial of basic human rights are
unacceptable and demand immediate action from the international community.

New Zealand has a proud history of standing up for justice and human rights on the global stage. I urge you,
as my elected representative, to advocate within Parliament for the New Zealand government to take a
stronger, more decisive stance.

Specifically, I ask that you please push for the following actions:
1. Publicly call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire.
2. Increase humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank.
3. Support international efforts to investigate all credible reports of war crimes and hold perpetrators
accountable.
4. Recognise the State of Palestine.

The people of Palestine have endured decades of occupation and hardship. It is our moral obligation to speak
out and act in solidarity with them.

Thank you for your time and attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your response outlining the
steps you will take.

Sincerely,
{Your Full Name?}
